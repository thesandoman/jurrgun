 *
 * How it works, because the two environments differ and that surprises people:
 *
 *   deployed   your app -> the SV Cloud data service -> your Postgres database
 *   locally    your app -> a Postgres running on your own machine
 *
 * Both go through the SAME Drizzle driver (`pg-proxy`), so a query that works in
 * one works in the other. Only the transport underneath changes. That is
 * deliberate: "works on my machine" is not a debugging experience anyone enjoys.
 *
 * Deployed, your app has no database password and never sees one — it holds a
 * token that only unlocks its own database, and the data service does the rest.
 * That is why there is no connection string to copy anywhere.
 *
 * **This app is not locked to SV Cloud.** It is a plain Worker (a V8 isolate),
 * and the branch below means that anywhere the data-service binding is absent,
 * it talks to whatever `DATABASE_URL` points at. Deploy it on any host that runs
 * isolates, point it at your own Postgres, and it runs unchanged.

 * point lookup and would benefit from running near the reader instead of

 * TIME ... WHERE ...`) — CockroachDB rejects it anywhere else, including at
 * the end of the statement. A query this function cannot place the clause
 * into (a join, a subquery, a CTE) throws before it reaches the database
 * rather than sending SQL that would fail with a confusing syntax error.
 *
 * **Rows come back as positional arrays, like `batch()`, NOT the mapped
 * objects `await db.select()...` normally gives you** — `getDb`'s Drizzle
